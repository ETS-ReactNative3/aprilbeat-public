- You can also play **custom songs** by dragging the APB File into
  the upload custom APB screen. There is also a community-supported beatmaps, you can find them using

- Thereâ€™s an **online internet ranking** system. You can compete with other
  players and see your rank online. We are also working on implementing a full real-time multiplayer using bi-directional socket.

- **Keyboard mode** (3-to-6 keys). Play along the music with your keyboard.

- Play together with friends in real-time using
  **party mode.** (beta)

- **Multiple difficulties.** Each song has multiple difficulties to accommodate
  every player skill levels.

- **Adjustable speed.** You can adjust the speed (spacing) of the notes to make
  it easy-to-sightread. This does not affect the speed of the song; lowering the
  speed causes notes to become more dense on-screen.

- [**Scoring and grading system.**](https://aprilbeatdocs.vercel.app/scoring-and-judgment)
  Master the song to get the S+ grade (score over 1000000 or "1 Million with 6 zeros").

- **Background Video support.** Certain selected songs will have a background video playing while playing.

- **Early/Late indicator.** Aprilbeat will tell you if you press the note too early
  or too late.

- **Audio latency compensation.** Some systems may have audio latency. Aprilbeat
  contains a comprehensive and smart calibration system to compensate for the audio latency.
